# First example C program for 351

1. Compile it on your local machine. You may need to install *make* and *gcc*. If you are on Windows, install *cygwin*, *git-bash*, or just use WSL. ***(Remember, on Windows, Chocolatey is your friend)***

2. Type *make* then *./fib*.

3. Write a program that takes three command line arguments. The first is an integer. The second is "r", or "i". The third is a file name.

4. Open the file. It should be a text file with an integer in the file (as a string, not binary). Read the file to get the integer. *(Error checking of file and params is not necessary)*

5. Add the two numbers together into a value N.

6. Compute the Nth Fibonacci number using one of the two methods (as specified on the command line):
i - iterative
r - recursive

7. Output the result (the Nth Fibonacci number).

8. Exit.

9. When tests pass, commit your repo and push to GitHub. Make sure you follow this [style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxHBu7b_pJxJFdo-ffcDpUzgyOHQNVn_s5E5GrWHI_o) that is also in Canvas as a Resource .

## Fibonacci numbers

* Fibonacci #1 is "0".

### Tests

Type *make test* to run them.

### Setup command

N/A

### Run command

`make test`

### Notes

* `gcc` can be used to compile and link C applications for use with existing test harnesses or C testing frameworks.
